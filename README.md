## What is VPC?

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated private cloud hosted within a public cloud. VPC customers can run code, store data, host websites, and do anything else they could do in an ordinary private cloud, but the private cloud is hosted remotely by a public cloud provider.

## CIDR

- Classless Inter-Domain Routing, or CIDR, is a means of allocating Internet Protocol addresses, also known as host addresses, more efficiently compared to the traditional classful network addressing system.
- CIDR blocks represent groups of IP addresses that have the same network prefixes and number of bits. Combining CIDR blocks that share a network prefix into a larger routing network is called supernetting, the single most important trait of CIDR.
