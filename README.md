## CIDR

- Classless Inter-Domain Routing, or CIDR, is a means of allocating Internet Protocol addresses, also known as host addresses, more efficiently compared to the traditional classful network addressing system.
- CIDR blocks represent groups of IP addresses that have the same network prefixes and number of bits. Combining CIDR blocks that share a network prefix into a larger routing network is called supernetting, the single most important trait of CIDR.
